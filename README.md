# Research Repo CRUD UI

A multi-user web app that adds a full CRUD interface, login, and git-based edit
attribution on top of the [Agentic UX Research Repo](../agentic-repo) (a
separate repo — this app reads/writes its markdown content but is not stored
inside it, to avoid risking that repo's working content).

**Stack:** React (Vite) frontend using the [Carbon Design
System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/) for accessibility-first components,
Node/Express backend, SQLite for user accounts and sessions only (markdown
files remain the source of truth for research content).

## Project structure

```
Research Repo CRUD UI/
├── backend/    Node/Express API — see backend/README.md for setup, env vars, and the full API reference
├── frontend/   React app — see frontend/README.md for setup (still being built out as of v0.9)
└── .gitignore
```

## Getting started

This is a two-part app — the backend must be running before the frontend can
do anything useful (it proxies all `/api` calls to it in dev). Start with
[`backend/README.md`](./backend/README.md) for setup, then
[`frontend/README.md`](./frontend/README.md).

## Roadmap

Continues the version numbering from the original research repo (v0.1–v0.5
shipped there). Full roadmap tracked in Notion: **Version Milestone Roadmap —
Research Repo CRUD UI**.

- [x] v0.6 — Backend Foundation (auth, sessions)
- [x] v0.7 — File CRUD API (sessions, records)
- [x] v0.8 — Git Attribution Layer
- [x] v0.9 — React Frontend: Auth + Browse
- [ ] v1.0 — React Frontend: Create/Edit/Delete
- [ ] v1.1 — Deploy + Polish
